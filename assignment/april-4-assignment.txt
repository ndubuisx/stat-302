1. What is dnorm()?

dnorm() is a built-in function used in R programming language. The function is used to calculate the density for a given normal distribution. It takes an x-value, mean, sd, and log as its parameters. The mean and standard deviation represent the parameters of the normal distribution, while the x-value is the point at which the probability density is being calculated. The function returns the probability density for a given set of data at a certain point.

2. What is pnorm()?

pnorm() is a built-in function used in R programming language. The pnorm() function is used to compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a given value of a random variable. The CDF is the probability that the random variable will take on a value less than or equal to the given value. Mathematically, it can be described as F(x) = P(X ≤ x); where X is the random variable and x is the given value. It is able to compute the CDF when given a random variable q, a population mean μ, and the population standard deviation σ.

3. What is qnorm()?

qnorm() is a built-in function used in R programming language. The qnorm() function in R is a function that calculates the inverse of the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution. This function takes a probability as an input and returns the corresponding value on the normal distribution. So given a number p between zero and one, qnorm looks up the p-th quantile of the normal distribution. The function is used to calculate the probability that a random variable will take on a value less than or equal to a given value. The qnorm() function is also referred to as the inverse of the pnorm() function.
